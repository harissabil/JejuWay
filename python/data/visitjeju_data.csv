The cone’s name is derived from the fact that it looks like a dragon (Yong) lying down, and is written as Yongwaak in Chinese characters. Another theory holds that the large dent in the middle of the mountain looks like a place where a dragon lied down, leading to the name Yongnuni Oreum Volcanic Cone.

It is a very unique forest where 2,800 Torreyas 
that are 500 - 800 years old block the sight of the sky, and it is the first forest park in Jejudo Island. 

At the corner of the forest, there is a Torreya called the “Tree of One Thousand Years” 
that is known as the ancestor of Torreyas. 
This tree is 14m high, with a branch length of 6m, and its width of crown is 15m. 
It is estimated to be more than 820 years old, which makes it the oldest Torreya in Jejudo Island. 
The Forest of Torreyas retains its leaves during the winter, so the forest stays green all throughout year. 
A substance called phytoncide emanates from the Forest of Torreyas. 
Phytoncide is known to have natural healing powers, such as helping blood circulation, 
alleviating mental and physical fatigue, and stabilizing biorhythm. 
There are two ways to exit the forest through the walking trail. 

One course is a shorter one that takes about 40 minutes and the other is a longer course 
which takes about 80 minutes. Baby strollers and wheelchairs are allowed in the 40 minute course, 
so anybody can enjoy the beauty of the forest regardless of age or gender.

The Face of Cheonjiyeon Falls 

Recently, a picture that captured a reflection of a rock that looks like a face is gaining lot of attention. The rock itself does not look too unique, but when the surface of water reflects the rock, the rock and the reflection look like a face. When seen from the left, it looks like the face of an adult, but when viewed from the right, it looks like the face of a baby. A representative of the General Services Office for Tourist Attractions said, “you wouldn’t think that it looks like a face when you look at the rock only, but just like decalcomania, if you look at the reflection and the rock together, it magically looks like a human’s face. The face is clearer in the afternoon, when the sun starts sinking in the west, than in the morning.”",20160530111636,20240810031755,"[{'seq': 38242, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CONT_000000000500618', 'label': 'Cheonjiyeon Falls', 'refId': 'CONT_000000000500618'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000000002', 'label': 'Tourist Sites', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000000002'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'cate0000000009', 'label': 'Natural Attractions', 'refId': 'cate0000000002>cate0000000009'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'cate0000000041', 'label': 'Waterfalls', 'refId': 'cate0000000009>cate0000000041'}, 'created': '20230707155021'}]",,294.0,,c1,Tourist Destination,contentscd>c1,region2,Seogwipo-si,region>region2,21,Seogwipo-si,region2>21,천지연폭포,2019022557647.0,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/imgpath/201907/11/7142cf44-ac03-420f-b07d-b83e06e8bfb9.jpg,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/thumbnailpath/201907/11/3dad325d-b992-425e-9355-8d625d562574.jpg,nature,

Songaksan Mountain was used as Japan’s forward operating base during its invasion of China, the last line of defense during the final hours of WWII.

Once upon a time, a dragon that lived in the underwater palace wanted to ascend to heaven, which was not an easy task. The dragon found out that it could fly up to heaven by holding the orb of the Hallasan Mountain God. So it stole the orb and hid itself under Yongyeon Valley, but it was caught before it could ascend. It was struck by the arrow shot by the Hallasan Mountain God and while it was writhing in anger and resentment, it became a rock. Yongduam Rock, like its name, is in the shape of a roaring dragon that looks like it is springing out from the ocean. When the wind and the waves are strong, it looks as if it might fly away to the sky. Its total height above water is 10m and the underwater portion of the body is about 30m long. If you gaze into Yongduam Rock during sunset, you’ll fall under the illusion that thedragon is actually writhing. In order to catch a good view of the rock, watching it from 100m west from the rock is most advisable.

It looks even better when the waves are strong, as it looks as if the Creation is taking place or if the dragon is roaring as it suffers from the wrath fo the heavens. It is one of the most famous spots that represent Jejudo Island. It is located 200m west from Yongyeon Valley, with countless numbers of tourists visiting it every day.

It is a bell-shaped tholoid that stands tall in the plains of southwest Jeju, allowing it to be seen from anywhere in the area. It is encircled by Ilju Road, which connects Moseulpo Port and Hwasun-ri. Well-maintained stairs are available so that tourists can climb up to Sanbanggulsa Grotto, which stands at the southern face of Namsa-myeon. If you wish to go up to the summit of Sanbangsan Mountain, you can use the trail behind Sanbangsan Mountain, which leads to Deoksu-ri, Yonghae-dong.


Due to its relatively tall height and proximity to the coast, Sanbangsan Mountain will often have clouds hanging or swirling around its summit, and the edge of each face of the mountain will show wildly diverging climate characteristics. Such climates make it an important sanctuary for vegetation, especially as it grants its native plants unique traits due to its volcanic environment. At the top of the mountain is a dense evergreen forest filled with silver magnolia, Siebold’s chinquapin, Yellowish velvety-leaf litsea, Japanese cinnamon, Sericeous Newlitse, and more. In particular, rare plants such as Centipede’s foot orchid and Glabrous Korean boxwood, which are rock wall plants, grow on the rock face, leading to the mountain being designated and protected as Natural Monument 182-5.


According to research, there are 79 families, 186 genera, 201 species, 33 varities, and 1 subspecies of vascular plants for a total of 255 species in the Sanbangsan Mountain. Three natural habitats for Single-leaf cremastra, Goering’s cymbidium, Caudate tick clover, Zanthoxylum coreanum, and Centipede’s foot orchid were found.

The summit of the volcanic cone houses a large and deep circular crater in the shape of a funnel, and the exterior circumference of the crater is close to 1,500m. The crater forms an oval that is extended to the north and south, with the northern side being fairly flat, and the crater’s depths is 115m, the same as that of Hallasan Mountain’s Baengnokdam Lake.

Oedolgae Rock, 20 m in height, is the first thing that you will see when you look at the rocks surrounding Namju’s Haegeumgang River and the Seogwipo Chilshipri Coast.

Since it is a strong rock carved by wave erosion, it is called a sea stack. At the peak of the island, there are pine trees that are regenerating.&nbsp;

Since it is isolated far from the land and located lonely in the middle of the sea, it was named Oedolgae Rock. There is also a legend that says that the rock is actually a grandmother who transformed into a rock after waiting for a grandfather to return from fishing, and so it is also called Grandma Rock.

The cone is named Baekyaki Oreum Volcanic Cone because a variety of medicinal herbs have grown naturally here since the old days. 
It is a 40-minute drive along Dongbu Industrial Road from Jeju-si to the entrance of Seongeup Farm in Seongeup 2(i)-ri. 
Entering the farm, you will see Gae Oreum Volcanic Cone standing like a sentinel on the left. You will encounter a Sageori after passing by a manager’s office and feed storage containers, where you will turn left to walk along a straight, paved road up to the shelters for workers. 
Over the shelter is Baekyaki Oreum Volcanic Cone. 
If you go further for about half an hour along the road beside the water fountains for cows, you can reach the summit of the cone, which has a sunken crater that resembles an amphitheater. 
At the summit of the cone, you have a view of a variety of other volcanic cones standing along the top of the mountain. 
Among them are Jwabomi Oreum Volcanic Cone in the east and inclines of a dry avalanche in front of it. 
To the northeast are Donggeomi Oreum Volcanic Cone alongside Munseoki Oreum Volcanic Cone.

So he cut off all the sources coming to the island and attempted to make his escape. But then, the God of Hallasan Mountain turned into a hawk and sank his ship. That is how Chagwido Island got its current name. Chagwido Island has 3 islands, which are called Jukdo Island and Odo Island and Jisiliseom Island. More and more tourists visit Chagwido Island in order to witness the famed magnificent view of the islands at sunset. Chagwido Island is also famous as a fishing spot, as its abudance of fish makes it popular among fishermen.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japanese Forces used Altteureu as an outpost, and when aircrafts from Japan laid over at Altteureu for fueling, they could conduct airstrikes on Shanghai, Beijing, and even Nanjing. Japanese Forces were expanding their frontline to the south and when the war broke out between the United States and Japan ignited by the Pearl Harbor Airstrike, they militarized the south coast and expanded Altteureu airport, which was 66㏊, to 264㏊. When their defeat was certain, Japanese Forces trained their suicide bombers here. Thus, it has a frightening but also very sad past.

Al Oreum Volcanic Cone lies aslant to the western foot of the volcanic cone, in front of the crater, and is called ‘Jeongmul Oreum Volcanic Cone.’ The inner foots of the crater (in front of the sign) has ‘Jeongmulsaem Spring (Ssangdulsaem Spring, Angyeongsaem Spring)’, which was once used for drinking water, as well as several springs for horses and cows to drink out of. As there is a spring known as ‘Jeongmeul > Jeongmul’ near the volcanic cone, it is known as ‘Jeongmuel Oreum Volcanic Cone > Jeongmul Oreum Volcanic Cone.’",20160530111636,20240810020105,"[{'seq': 28392, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CONT_000000000500530', 'label': 'Jeongmul Oreum Volcanic Cone', 'refId': 'CONT_000000000500530'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000000002', 'label': 'Tourist Sites', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000000002'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'cate0000000009', 'label': 'Natural Attractions', 'refId': 'cate0000000002>cate0000000009'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'cate0000000035', 'label': 'Volcanic Cones', 'refId': 'cate0000000009>cate0000000035'}, 'created': '20211228144754'}]",,19.0,,c1,Tourist Destination,contentscd>c1,region1,Jeju-si,region>region1,13,Hallim,region1>13,Jeongmul Oreum Volcanic Cone,19433.0,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/imgpath/201804/30/3b0de630-53e5-4271-a3f4-f8d7296dbe9f.jpg,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/thumbnailpath/201804/30/164fe52f-47be-4993-b11d-eeefcb02022e.jpg,nature,

If you are standing at Oedolgae Rock, which is located near Seogwipo Sammaebong Peak Park, you can see an island that is floating on your left side. That is Munseom Island. How it got its name is also very interesting. One theory says that it is called Munseom Island because the island has many mosquitoes (“Mun” in Chinese character means ‘mosquito’: 蚊). According to another legend, a hunter’s bow case grazed the Jade Emperor’s belly by mistake at Hallasan Mountain, and the Jade Emperor was so furious that he threw the peak of Hallasan Mountain. The peak broke into two pieces, becoming Munseom Island and Beomseom Island. And the place where the peak of Hallasan Mountain was located became Baengnokdam Lake. Munseom Island is a good place to fish for red seabreams, rock breams, black sea breams, and chicken grunts. A good period to fish is from September to November. Munseom Island is a natural habitat for soft coral colonies that possess a beauty that awes divers. Corals only grow in places that are rich in plankton and where nothing floats on water. Munseom Island is a perfect habitat for corals because the sunlight reaches 40m deep into the water.

조선 명종 14년인 1559년 강려 목사가 부임하면서 구엄리 주민들에게 소금을 생산하는 방법을 가르쳤다. 바위 위에 찰흙으로 둑을 쌓고 그곳에 고인 바닷물이 햇볕에 마르면서 생기는 소금을 얻어내는 방식으로 구엄마을 주민들의 주요 생업의 터진이 되었다.

The northwestern slope of the volcanic cone has a valley hollowed out, and massive volcanic bombs are scattered between the inclines. The crater at the summit has an exterior circumference of around 1,000m. It is in the shape of a sea bass, and a pond has taken up residence inside it. It is one of the few crater lakes to exist among Jeju’s parasitic cones, and is full of water all year round. The volcanic cone is known as Chuljat Oreum Volcanic Cone, Meulchat Oreum Volcanic Cone, Suseongak, Muljwajilak, Sulseongbong, Geomeun Oruem Volcanic Cone, Geomunak, and Mulchat Oreum Volcanic Cone. According to ancient records, ‘Muljat Oreum Volcanic Cone’ and ‘Mulchat Oreum Volcanic Cone’ appear to be names arising from that fact that there was water (Mul) on the crater in the summit as well as rocks stacked like a castle (Jat) or because the peaks formed a cliff. ‘Mulchat Oreum Volcanic Cone’ began to be called “Geomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone’ starting from the Japanese Occupation. This was because it was written as ‘Gemunak / Geomun Oreum Volcanic Cone’ on 1:25,000 maps published during the era. Maps released after this also called it by this name or simply wrote it as ‘Geomun Oreum Volcanic Cone.’ However, it should be called and written as ‘Mulchat Oreum Voclanic Cone’, its original name. All slopes of the volcanic cone are covered in a lush natural deciduous forest of Rhododendron Weyrichii, Ilex Crenata, and Palmate Maple.

높고 뾰족한 오름이 노꼬메큰오름이고 그 옆의 낮은 오름이 노꼬메족은오름이다. 
노꼬메큰오름은 해발 800m의 높이와 가파른 사면을 이루고 두 개의 봉우리를 품고 있는 큰 화산체다.
북쪽의 봉우리가 주봉으로 정상이고 화구 방향인 북서쪽에 소구릉들이 산재되어 있으며
원형 화구였던 것이 침식되어 북서쪽으로 벌어진 말굽형 화구를 이루었다.


‘노꼬’의 어원은 정확하지 않지만 한자표기가 鹿古岳(녹고악), 鹿高岳(녹고악)등으로 표기되어 있는 것으로
옛날 사슴이 내려와 이 오름에 살았었다는 것에 비롯된 것이 아닌가 하는 설이 있다.
오름 탐방로 초반에는 완만한 숲길이 이어지다가 가팔라지지만, 중간에 두 개의 쉼터가 있어 숨을 고를 수 있다.

노꼬메큰오름의 정상 전망에 서면 노꼬메족은오름을 비롯한 크고 작은 오름들이 펼쳐지고 한라산과 한림 앞바다가 선명하게 보인다. 
가을에는 바람에 일렁이는 억새를 한눈에 담을 수 있다.

It had a circumference of approximately 89m and a height of approximately 2m. Byeolbangseong Fortress was built in 1510 during the 5th year of King Jungjong’s reign. Jang Lim, who was the Moksa of Jeju in 1510, built the fortress as a military base to defend the island against the Japanese and named it Byeolbangseong Fortress by moving Kimnyeongbanghoso into it. Kim Sang-heon wrote in his book Namsarok that the fortress had a well filled with salty water inside and three gates to the east, west, and south. The place contained Daebyeoncheong in the north fortress and armory, accommodations, and military education facilities in the center. In the past the place was called Uitan-ri, Hado. Another book called Seogye, written by Park Cheon-hyeong, indicates that the east and north side of the fortress were adjacent to the sea. The book also mentions that the fortress was not an ideal place to have battleships anchored because the dock was too narrow and rough rocks at the shore could damage ships. In his book, Park concluded that the castle is not a good military base overall, considering various factors and advised that residents should install lights and be careful when walking. Personnel included were Jobangjang (1), Chichong (4), Seongjeonggun (510), Yujikgun (148), Seogi (15), Byeoljang (30) for the 2 Sogwan Beacon Fire Stations and 3 Yeondae, Bonggun (84), and 1 Donghuseon boat. In 1848, the 14th year of King Heonjong’s reign, Moksa Jang In-sik built an extension to the original fortress. It is said that during the period of extension, many construction workers suffered from starvation due to a severe famine.

Since the bodies were unidentifiable, it was named with meaning of “One Descendant of Grandfather Baek”. However, in 1961, it went through hardship of memorial stone being destroyed due to violence in 5.16 coup d’eta.

These caves are about 3m - 4m wide and about 20m long. Like the one near Seongsan Ilculbong Peak, these caves were made for hiding torpedo boats from the Allied Forces. There are many traces of Japanese Imperialism in Jejudo Island. There are traces of all kinds of tochika facilities not just in this coastal region but on the middle mountainous areas as well. Tens of thousands of people had to face death in Okinawa during World War II. If the Allied Forces had chosen to strike Jejudo Island instead of Okinawa, Japanese Forces might have killed the residents in Jejudo Island. There are still traces of war in the beautiful Jejudo Island. Though not many people visit it, it is the largest military historic site in Korea that shows Japanese Imperialism. It is a sad and hideous remanent of tragedy that Jejudo Island is hiding under its beauty.",20160530111636,20240810020102,"[{'seq': 33502, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CONT_000000000500379', 'label': 'Songaksan Mountain Cave Fortification', 'refId': 'CONT_000000000500379'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000000002', 'label': 'Tourist Sites', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000000002'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'cate0000000009', 'label': 'Natural Attractions', 'refId': 'cate0000000002>cate0000000009'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'cate0000000045', 'label': 'Caves', 'refId': 'cate0000000009>cate0000000045'}, 'created': '20221205175925'}]",,2.0,,c1,Tourist Destination,contentscd>c1,region2,Seogwipo-si,region>region2,22,Daejong,region2>22,송악산 진지동굴,2019022593477.0,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/imgpath/202112/07/4891ca3d-df51-43ff-935c-5c5e20240370.jpg,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/thumbnailpath/202112/07/b2b36cbf-5347-4237-8ab1-ccb6198b55c3.jpg,nature,

A tall square wall made by stacking natural stones surrounds a one-room stone chamber with a tiled roof. The ancestral tablet of Geumbaekjo, the God of Bonhyang, was enshrined inside this stone chamber. The natives of Jejudo Island call gods who protect and govern their livelihoods “God of Byonhyang” and designate shrines known as “Bonghyangdang Shrines” for these gods. These shrines used to exist in every town of Jejudo Island. Today, the descendants of Songdang-ri’s gods are enshrined and worshipped outside Songdang-ri. In July 2009, Jeju-si designated 31 sites that represent Jejudo Island besides the already famous tourist sites, and Songdang Bonhyangdang Shrine was chosen as one of these 31 hidden views of Jeju-si.

It is a rare hybrid volcanic edifice with funnel-shaped circular craters (2) and a horseshoe-shaped crater that looks like a straw basket, and looks quite different from other volcanic cones. Most of the slopes are steep, though the northeastern slope is relatively gradual and has a small path that can be used to go in any direction. There are 4 distinct peaks at the summit, and the main peak is the pyramid-style peak to the west. The western foot of the volcanic cone runs along the path on the side of the hill and meets ‘Munseoki Oreum Volcanic Cone’, and going through Munseoki Oreum Volcanic Cone will lead to a view of the second funnel. The eastern region, which goes from the southwestern foot to the northeastern foot, has a continuation of hills and forms a jagged intense curve, with the foot being scattered with countless Oreumsaekki (Iryugu). It is a sight comparable to that of looking down on the crowded group of parasitic cones from the top of Hallasan Mountain. Geomi Oreum Volcanic Cone’s name originates from the fact that it looks like a spider’s (Geomi) web, as its slopes are round and have hilly layers that spread from the mountain top in all directions. It is also assumed that the many strands of the ridges evoke the image of a spider itself. Other names for the volcanic cone include Donggeomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone, Donggeomeunak (東巨文岳), Donggeomunak (東巨門岳), and Donggeomuniak (東巨門伊岳). Because there is already a Geomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone to the west in Songdang-ri, that cone is called Seogeomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone while Geomi Oreum Volcanic Cone is called Donggeomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone. Seogeomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone covers the border of Jocheon-eup, while Donggeomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone is located on the border of Seongsan-eup and Pyroseon-myeon. It is known as ‘Donggeomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone’ or Donggeomeuni (Oreum Volcanic Cone) to distinguish itself from ‘Seogeomeun Oreum Volcanic Cone’ in Seonheul-ri, Jocheon-eup, as one is in the east (Dong) while the other is in the west (Seo).

The western side has a cliff facing the sea and the double hybrid volcanic edifice to the north. The Dang in the name Cheodang Oreum Volcanic Cone stands for shrine. It is said that the foot of this mountain held a shrine that worshipped a snake deity called ‘Sagwi’. Sagwi was misinterpreted through the years into Chagwi and the shrine was named ‘Chagwidang Shrine’. The volcanic cone received its name from the shrine and got its name Chagwi Oreum Volcanic Cone. Dangsanbong Volcanic Cone is the name of this volcanic cone in Chinese characters. The creek that runs from the southeast to the southwest is called Jagwinae or Jagunae. In Tamra-jido, a map of Jeju Island, the creek was displayed as Jagwinae and Jagunae. As Jagwitbengdui was co-displayed in Chinese characters, it can be assumed that the term was a secondary name for Jagwi or Jagu. The name Chagwi is a reading of the name in modern Chinese character pronounciation. It is fair to call this Jagwi as the locals have been calling this creek as Jagwinae. Due to its proximity with the creek, this volcanic cone was named Jagwi Oreum Volcanic Cone. When the Jagwidang Shrine was built, the volcanic cone was called Dangsan Oreum Volcanic Cone.

The vegetation in the area mainly consists of Hubaknamu, Sangdalnamu, and Jonggasinamu trees, which compose the higher elevation of the forest, and spearflowers and Asiatic jasmine cover the lower area. Also, Japanese ivies climb into the canopy of the tall trees. The species of trees are relatively simple but are very typical of those that grow in temperate zones.

It is owned by Daeheungsa Temple. The black pine tree is a large coniferous evergreen in the pine tree family. Its common names in Korean are pine tree, Geomsol or Heuksong because its bark is black (“Heuk” in Korean means black). In Korea it are classified as Subgenus Diploxylon along with the pine tree. Black pine trees are spread out along the sea coast from the west (Gyeonggi-do) to the east (Myeongju-gun, Gangwon-do). Their main habitat is the southern region of Korea and below 700m altitude in Jejudo Island. They have low tolerance for cold, so they cannot grow inland of the central district or inside deep forests. The bark of the tree is dark brown and the winter buds forming at the ends of the branches are white, making them easily distinguishable from the reddish pine trees. The leaves are dark green, with slightly twisted bodies and sharp tips. These leaves tend to be 9 ~ 14cm in length and 2 leaves for a leaf sheath. The black pines of Jeju-si form a colony in Sancheondan Altar, which is approximately 8km in the direction of Seogwipo-si from Jeju-si on Highway 1.

Heights range between 21m to 30m, with 4 trees being 30m and 3 trees being 25m tall. The girths range from 3.4m to 6m, and the width of the crown of the tree is between 12m and 24m. It is estimated that these trees are between 500 and 600 years old. They are currently the largest known trees in Jejudo Island, and while they benefit from relatively favorable growth and ecology, a few of them have branches that grow mainly on one side as a result of damage from the wind.

Gaksubau is written as Gaksuak or Gaksuam because the shape of the rocks here resembles a bull’s horns sprouting from a head.

This oreum consists of two cone-shaped volcanic cones and residents call the southwestern peak Seogeolseo and the northeastern peak Donggeolseo.

It is written as Geolseoak in Chinese characters after borrowing the pronunciation of Chinese characters for Geolseoak Oreum.

The total length of the cave is about 180m. The tube stretches to both the east and west. The east tunnel has sunk due to weathered seashells approximately 50m in. The west tunnel is about 2m - 3m high, 7m - 15m wide, and 100m long. The end of the west lava tube has sunk due to weathered seashells but the strike suggests that it is connected to Ssangnyonggul Cave. There are many stalactites hanging from the ceiling, and you can see black basalt around the root of the stalactites, which makes for a unique sight.

This painting was inspired by Su Shih Portrait, which is a painting of Sodongpa (a Chinese Poet).
It is a valuable asset because it depicts how Chusa spent his time in exile.
Chusa had always admired Sodongpa, which may be the reason why their lives were so similar.
Sodongpa, who was one of Best Eight Writers of Dang and Song, was promoted to the highest position as a government worker, but was exiled to Haenamdo Island due to political reasons. Similarly, Chusa lead a successful life as a government worker but later was exiled to Jejudo Island because he was framed of a conspiracy.
Chusa must have comforted himself thinking of Sodongpa’s life due to their similarities. Sochi used to visit the exiled Chusa in Jeju several times and spent time with him.
He listened to Chusa’s words and learned painting, poetry reading, and calligraphy from Chusa.

In order to thank the virtue and influence of the general, the islanders built a shrine, and they pray at the shrine every spring and autumn. 
In 1970, thanks to the financial support from the national treasury, the shrine was restored and it was designated as a City/Province-Designated Monument in August 1971. In 1974, the Dancheong (traditional multicolored paintwork on wooden buildings) and the fence were repaired, restoring the shrine to its original form.

 Welcome to the first Teddy Bear Museum in Korea. Here you will find everything you want to know about Teddy Bears.
Teddy Bears have been loved and cherished since they were first introduced over 100 years ago. There are now millions of people who collect Teddy Bears.
They seek out old, unique and valuable teddy bears for their personal collections. Our Teddy Bear Museum opened especially for the European collectors.
The Teddy Bear Museum is more exciting than ever with ""Teddy Bear"" entertainment as never seen before. Jeju Teddy Bear Museum opened on April 24, 2001.
It contains two galleries, a museum gift shop, and a museum cafe.
Also, on site is a museum bar/restaurant, a wonderful place to meet friends, family, and lovers. From the outside garden, there is a view of Jung-Mun Beach.

곶자왈이란 나무, 덩굴식물, 암석 등이 뒤섞여 수풀처럼 어수선하게 된 곳을 일컫는 제주도 방언으로, 

특히 제주 곶자왈은 세계에서 유일하게 열대 북방한계 식물과 남방한계 식물이 공존하는 특별한 곳이다.&nbsp; 

제주 곶자왈 도립공원은 다양한 생명들이 살아 숨 쉬는 신비로운 곳인 곶자왈의 생태를 보호하고, 

사람들에게 휴양 공간, 체험·학습 등을 제공하는 생태관광지이다. 






총 5개의 코스가 있어 다양한 곶자왈의 모습을 감상할 수 있다.&nbsp; 

이곳의 길은 포장된 길이 아니기 때문에 긴팔, 긴바지와 함께 걷기 편한 신발을 신고 오는 것이 좋고, 

구두나 샌들, 키높이 운동화 착용 시에는 탐방이 금지된다. 

탐방로를 걷다 보면 다양한 식물, 곤충 등의 들을 만날 수 있어 도시에서는 볼 수 없는 모습을 마음껏 눈에 담을 수 있다. 

동식물들뿐만 아니라 다양한 형태의 암석들을 구경하는 재미도 있다.&nbsp;







전망대에 오르면 넓게 펼쳐진 숲의 푸른 전경과 주변 오름 등을 조망할 수 있어 발걸음을 뗄 수 없게 만드는 풍경을 연출한다. 

곶자왈 입구에는 카페도 자리 잡고 있기 때문에 곶자왈 탐방을 끝내고 난 후 휴식을 취할 수 있다.

조선 명종 14년인 1559년 강려 목사가 부임하면서 구엄리 주민들에게 소금을 생산하는 방법을 가르쳤다. 바위 위에 찰흙으로 둑을 쌓고 그곳에 고인 바닷물이 햇볕에 마르면서 생기는 소금을 얻어내는 방식으로 구엄마을 주민들의 주요 생업의 터진이 되었다. 

소금밭은 약 390여 년 동안 마을 주민들의 생업의 터전이자 삶의 근간이 되어왔던 곳이다. 품질이 뛰어난 천일염이 생산되다가 해방 이후 폐기되어 지금은 소금생산을 하지 않고 있지만&nbsp;2009년에 제주시가 예산을 투입하여 돌염전을 일부 복원하고 관광안내센터와 주차장 등을 설치하였다. 돌염전의 유래, 소금의 생산방법 등 다양한 정보가 있는 안내판들이 곳곳에 설치되어 있어 여행자들에게 생소한 소금생산방식과 돌염전에 대한 정보를 제공한다.

“A secret garden cultivated for 25 years by KC-Cotrell’s president Lee Dal-woo, a lover of Jeju”

Jeju Sanghyowon is a fantastic, large scale botanical garden covering more than 260,000 square meters located on the Jeju, the beautiful island of the southern tip of the Korean peninsula.

Sanghyowon is located with Hallasan Mountain in the backdrop to the north, and the sea of Seogwipo to the south, on a gentle slope towards the foot of the mountain, about 300 to 400 meters above sea level.
Not only are there plants native to Jeju such as the Hallan(Smoothlip Cymbidium) and Saeuran(Calanthe Discolor), but also botanical gardens, diverse plant species, and rarities such as evergreens and other old large trees over 100 years old, so to say that this is the most comprehensive botanical garden in Asia is no exaggeration.

According to a legend regarding the stone pagoda, during Yuan Dynasty, the 11th King Sunje did not have a son to succeed his throne, which was a constant source of worry for him. A monk advised the king to offer a Buddhist mass by constructing a tower on a Samcheopchilbong (a three folded mountain surrounded by other six smaller mountains) that was touched by the Big Dipper’s energy. His subjects found Wondangbong Volcanic Cone, a Samcheopchilbong at the northeast coast of Tamnaguk that was under the control of Yuan at the time, and built Wondangsa Temple and stone pagoda on the cone and the 6 smaller mountains nearby and offered a mass. Bultapsa Temple was reconstructed at the original site of Wondangsa Temple at the foot of the 170.4m tall Wondangbong Volcanic Cone, where the five story tower remains.

Under the reign of King Gongmin, rebellions broke out every minute and even the Jeju Moksa was slaughtered by insurgents. In order to suppress the rebellion, King Gongmin ordered General Choe Yeong to put down the insurgents in 1374 (the 23rd year of King Gongmin’s reign). General Choe Yeong’s army had to evacuate to Chujado Island after encountering a powerful gale at sea during their expedition to Jejudo Island. On the island, the general taught the islanders how to catch fish with nets and that brought revolution to their. Ever since then, villagers have shown their gratitude by building a shrine for General Choe Yeong. Every year, on the 15th of July and the last day of December of the lunar calendar, they pray for a good harvest and a good haul.
In order to suppress the rebellion of Mokho Seokjilli from Yuan and other rebellions in Tamna (currently known as Jejudo Island), King Gongmin ordered General Choe Yeong to put down the insurgent in 1374 (the 23rd year of King Gongmin’s reign). General Choe Yeong’s army had to evacuate to Jeomsangot after encountering a powerful gale at the sea during their expedition to Jejudo Island. On the island, the general taught the islanders how to catch fish with nets and that brought revolution to the lives of the resident of Chujado Island. In order to thank the virtue and influence of the general, the islanders built a shrine, and they pray at the shrine every spring and autumn. 
In 1970, thanks to the financial support from the national treasury, the shrine was restored and it was designated as a City/Province-Designated Monument in August 1971. In 1974, the Dancheong (traditional multicolored paintwork on wooden buildings) and the fence were repaired, restoring the shrine to its original form.

There is a spring called “Jangsumul” which is also known as the place where General Kim Tong-jeong jumped to kill himself, and his footprints have been left on the land. The water from this spring, however, is undrinkable. Sambyeolcho was originally an elite military unit during the Goryeo Dynasty. The unit strongly opposed the peace treaty between Goryeo and the Mongols that was signed in February of the 11th year of King Wonjong’s reign (1270). In resistance, Sambyeolcho went down to Jindo Island, Jeolla-do, to continue their fight against the Mongolians. When they were defeated there, the unit retreated again to Jejudo Island to continue their resistance activities, which lasted around 2 years. In April of the 14th year of King Wonjong, not a single member of Sambyeolcho remained.

It is a bell-shaped tholoid that stands tall in the plains of southwest Jeju, allowing it to be seen from anywhere in the area. It is encircled by Ilju Road, which connects Moseulpo Port and Hwasun-ri. Stairs are well-made so that tourists can climb up to Sanbanggulsa Grotto, which stands at the southern face of Namsa-myeon. If you wish to go up to the summit of Sanbangsan Mountain, you can use the trail behind Sanbangsan Mountain which leads to Deoksu-ri, Yonghae-dong. Due to its relatively tall height and proximity to the coast, Sanbangsan Mountain will often have clouds hanging or swirling around its summit, and the edge of each face of the mountain will show wildly diverging climate characteristics. Such climate makes it an important sanctuary for vegetation because it has a unique trait as a volcano. At the top of the mountain is a dense evergreen forest filled with silver magnolia, Siebold’s chinquapin, Yellowish velvety-leaf litsea, Japanese cinnamon, Sericeous Newlitse, and more. In particular, rare plants such as Centipede’s foot orchid and Glabrous Korean boxwood, which are rock wall plants, are grown on the rock face, leading to the mountain being designated and protected as Natural Monument 182-5. According to research, there are 79 families, 186 genera, 201 species, 33 varities, and 1 subspecies of vascular plants for a total of 255 species in the Sanbangsan Mountain. Three natural habitats for Single-leaf cremastra, Goering’s cymbidium, Caudate tick clover, Zanthoxylum coreanum and Centipede’s foot orchid were found. [Origin] Sanbang refers to a cave within a mountain, and Sanbangsan Mountain derives its name from the fact that there is a sea cave located around 150m above sea level on its southern face.

On December 10th, another religious ceremony called Geonsidaeje (annual ceremony) is held by the government of Jejudo Island. In this event, the governor serves as the Choheongwan, while local authorities serve as Aheongwan and Jongheongwan.

It had a circumference of approximately 89m and a height of approximately 2m. Byeolbangseong Fortress was built in 1510 during the 5th year of King Jungjong’s reign. Jang Lim, who was the Moksa of Jeju in 1510, built the fortress as a military base to defend the island against the Japanese and named it Byeolbangseong Fortress by moving Kimnyeongbanghoso into it. Kim Sang-heon wrote in his book Namsarok that the fortress had a well filled with salty water inside and three gates to the east, west, and south. The place contained Daebyeoncheong in the north fortress and armory, accommodations, and military education facilities in the center. In the past the place was called Uitan-ri, Hado. Another book called Seogye, written by Park Cheon-hyeong, indicates that the east and north side of the fortress were adjacent to the sea. The book also mentions that the fortress was not an ideal place to have battleships anchored because the dock was too narrow and rough rocks at the shore could damage ships. In his book, Park concluded that the castle is not a good military base overall, considering various factors and advised that residents should install lights and be careful when walking. Personnel included were Jobangjang (1), Chichong (4), Seongjeonggun (510), Yujikgun (148), Seogi (15), Byeoljang (30) for the 2 Sogwan Beacon Fire Stations and 3 Yeondae, Bonggun (84), and 1 Donghuseon boat. In 1848, the 14th year of King Heonjong’s reign, Moksa Jang In-sik built an extension to the original fortress. It is said that during the period of extension, many construction workers suffered from starvation due to a severe famine.

Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School was established during Joseon Dynasty's King Taejong year 16 (1416) and was moved several times to different locations due to the reason that the site was not good, and was finally settled in current location in King Hyojong year 4 (1653). In King Yeongjo year 48 (1772), Myeongryundang Lecture Hall was rebuilt and in King Heonjong year 1 (1834), Daeseongjeon Shrine was rebuilt.

Today, about 150m of the Namsugak Pavilion, which is a part of the fortress, has been restored. The fortress boasts a long history and has constantly protected the center district of Jejudo Island, but is tragically in a very poor condition.

The groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 10th, 1988 (lunar calendar) and the construction was completed on August 15th, 1988. 「The Buddha Sharira Stupa for World’s Peace and Unification」 was built to signify many Buddhists’ wishes and prayers for the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. The tower was actually built to face the spiritual Baekdusan Mountain, the most ethnically significant mountain of Korea. Also, the tower serves as a point on the straight line connecting Baekdusan Mountain and Hallasan Mountain. It was constructed that way on purpose to connect the two mountains so that the whole Korean peninsula can be covered by people’s prayer for reunification. The tower is 33m high, with 33 being a reference to 33,000, and the floor’s area of 360 pyeong (1,190m2) signifies a Buddhist principle called “Wonyungmuae.” Records suggest that the tower’s grandiose Giwamanbul was carefully and delicately designed and constructed by monks and believers over the course of four years. Believers say that the efforts succeeded in impressing God, who rewarded them by ensuring a very bright and shiny weather on the day of the unveiling on April 26th, 1995. This place is also known for the place where two great Buddhist priests, 「Heoungdang Boudaeseonsa」 and 「Hwanseongdang Jiandaejongsa」, who were at the center of the Buddhist revival during the Joseon Dynasty, were martyred. Moreover, the place is known as the birthplace of the scripture transcribing movement that is popular among Buddhists worldwide today.

Wondangsa Temple was also restored across from it, albeit in a reduced sized. However, the condition of this five-story stone pagoda is quite satisfactory, so it is highly valued for its historical and artistic merits by those studying of the history of Goryeo.
According to a legend regarding the stone pagoda, during Yuan Dynasty, the 11th King Sunje did not have a son to succeed his throne, which was a constant source of worry for him. A monk advised the king to offer a Buddhist mass by constructing a tower on a Samcheopchilbong (a three folded mountain surrounded by other six smaller mountains) that was touched by the Big Dipper’s energy. His subjects found Wondangbong Volcanic Cone, a Samcheopchilbong at the northeast coast of Tamnaguk that was under the control of Yuan at the time, and built Wondangsa Temple and stone pagoda on the cone and the 6 smaller mountains nearby and offered a mass. Bultapsa Temple was reconstructed at the original site of Wondangsa Temple at the foot of the 170.4m tall Wondangbong Volcanic Cone, where the five story tower remains.

This painting was inspired by Su Shih Portrait, which is a painting of Sodongpa (a Chinese Poet).
It is a valuable asset because it depicts how Chusa spent his time in exile.
Chusa had always admired Sodongpa, which may be the reason why their lives were so similar.
Sodongpa, who was one of Best Eight Writers of Dang and Song, was promoted to the highest position as a government worker, but was exiled to Haenamdo Island due to political reasons. Similarly, Chusa lead a successful life as a government worker but later was exiled to Jejudo Island because he was framed of a conspiracy.
Chusa must have comforted himself thinking of Sodongpa’s life due to their similarities. Sochi used to visit the exiled Chusa in Jeju several times and spent time with him.
He listened to Chusa’s words and learned painting, poetry reading, and calligraphy from Chusa. He also delivered the tea grown by Cho-ui Buddhist Monk to Chusa and presented Chusa’s calligraphy to King Heonjong.

Under the reign of King Gongmin, rebellions broke out every minute and even the Jeju Moksa was slaughtered by insurgents. In order to suppress the rebellion, King Gongmin ordered General Choe Yeong to put down the insurgents in 1374 (the 23rd year of King Gongmin’s reign). General Choe Yeong’s army had to evacuate to Chujado Island after encountering a powerful gale at sea during their expedition to Jejudo Island. On the island, the general taught the islanders how to catch fish with nets and that brought revolution to their. Ever since then, villagers have shown their gratitude by building a shrine for General Choe Yeong. Every year, on the 15th of July and the last day of December of the lunar calendar, they pray for a good harvest and a good haul.
In order to suppress the rebellion of Mokho Seokjilli from Yuan and other rebellions in Tamna (currently known as Jejudo Island), King Gongmin ordered General Choe Yeong to put down the insurgent in 1374 (the 23rd year of King Gongmin’s reign).

In order to thank the virtue and influence of the general, the islanders built a shrine, and they pray at the shrine every spring and autumn. 
In 1970, thanks to the financial support from the national treasury, the shrine was restored and it was designated as a City/Province-Designated Monument in August 1971. In 1974, the Dancheong (traditional multicolored paintwork on wooden buildings) and the fence were repaired, restoring the shrine to its original form.

Kkakkeuraegi is a relatively small volcanic cone with a gentle slope of about 50 meters. On it are areas of cedar, bamboo and pampas grass near its summit. You can take in the beautiful scenery from here.

The peculiar name of this oreum is derived from its shape, with a small valley on its southern side.

Climbing Kkakkeuraegi is relatively easy. Please note though that once you get to the top, please do not descend into the concave crater. Access is is prohibited.

하지만 이곳에서 가장 특색있는 체험이라면 유기농 블루베리로 직접 만들어보는 ‘블루베리 청’과 ‘블루베리 케이크’ 만들기 체험이 아닐까. 블루베리 청에는 다른 재료가 들어가지 않는다. 블루베리를 냄비에 듬뿍 넣고, 한참 동안 조려주면 블루베리 자체에서 물기가 생긴다. 설탕을 넣고, 졸아든 만큼 블루베리를 더 넣어서 달콤하게 조린다. 완성된 블루베리 청은 따뜻한 차나 시원한 에이드를 만들어 음료로도 즐길 수 있고, 빵에 발라먹어도 블루베리의 향과 달콤한 맛을 즐길 수 있다. 블루베리 케이크 체험 역시 아이들이 좋아하는 체험이다. 케이크 빵을 반으로 갈라 생크림을 잔뜩 얹어 만든다. 원하는 만큼 블루베리를 넣고 빵을 덮은 후, 다시 생크림을 발라 감귤과 허브, 블루베리로 장식한다. 엄마와 아이가 함께 체험했기에 뿌듯함은 더하고 무슨 재료로 만들었는지를 알 수 있어 아이들에게 먹일 때 부담감은 덜하다.

이외에도 인형 만들기 체험, 마크라메 만들기 체험, 드림캐쳐 만들기 체험 등의 수공예품 체험도 진행할 수 있다. 너무 어린아이들은 진행하기 힘드나, 느긋하게 시간을 갖고 체험한다면 아이들의 집중력을 키우기에도 도움이 된다.",20181129131618,20240809143650,"[{'seq': 45168, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CNTS_200000000007938', 'label': 'Polgae Cooperative Alliance', 'refId': 'CNTS_200000000007938'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000000002', 'label': 'Tourist Sites', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000000002'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'cate0000000011', 'label': 'Leisure/Experience', 'refId': 'cate0000000002>cate0000000011'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'cate0000001368', 'label': 'Experience', 'refId': 'cate0000000011>cate0000001368'}, 'created': '20240730090833'}, {'seq': 45169, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CNTS_200000000007938', 'label': 'Polgae Cooperative Alliance', 'refId': 'CNTS_200000000007938'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000000002', 'label': 'Tourist Sites', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000000002'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'wellness', 'label': 'Wellness Tourism', 'refId': 'cate0000000002>wellness'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'wellness_view', 'label': 'Wellness  Tourism', 'refId': 'wellness>wellness_view'}, 'created': '20240730090833'}]",,0.0,,c2,Shopping,contentscd>c2,region2,Seogwipo-si,region>region2,25,Namwon,region2>25,폴개협동조합,2019022581719.0,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/imgpath/202108/03/4ec9390a-d980-412f-8de7-f7c81c834488.jpg,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/thumbnailpath/202108/03/a6c92dc2-c75a-4a12-8ab8-dff447c4d5e1.jpg,experiences,

Aqua BEAutique has a slogan of BEA(Beautiful experience for All) which reflects our hope to provide a beautiful experience for all.
It is not an easy option in Korea to escape to a luxury hotel or pool villa where you can enjoy the beautiful blue ocean, a comfortable stay and even a private pool just to avoid a stressful, hectic life mainly due to high costs. Rather, it is regarded as a choice for a very special holiday. Being aware of this, we have come up with a very easy solution for you. We have eliminated and downsized all the unnecessary facilities, reduced the size of the villa, and customized the stay for guests to provide you with an affordable option.
Each Aqua BEAutique room provides a private mini pool operated during all seasons except for winter. Each room has a wide three sided clear ocean view, not to mention an emerald crystal Woljeong beach no more than 200 meters away. It is too good to be captured by a camera. We highly recommend you to see this mesmerizing beauty with your loved ones.

구좌읍 세화리에 위치한 차와 다양한 제주관련 소품을 함께 판매하는 카페다. 
북적거리는 분위기 보다는 쉬고 싶은 다른 사람들을 존중하는 분위기가 지배적이다.
메뉴판 위에도 '조용한 힐링카페를 지향한다'는 캘리그라피 문구가 쓰여 있다.
구좌읍 당근으로 만든 수제 케이크와 제주 영귤, 댕유자로 만든 에이드 음료가 있고 따뜻한 차와 커피는 언제든 맛볼 수 있다.

인기의 비결 첫 번째는 역시 신선한 재료다. 이 집에서는 도축장에서 바로 나와 신선한 제주 흑돼지를 쓴다. 메뉴는 단 두 가지.&nbsp;그것도 부위가 아니라 400/600g 근고기 단위로 판매한다. 육즙이 풍부한 목살과 오겹살을 골고루 함께 맛볼 수 있도록 한 배려다. 연탄을 사용하는 것은 마지막 화룡점정이다.&nbsp;특유의 매력적인 불향을 입힐 뿐만 아니라, 숯불구이보다 고기를 부드럽게 만들기 때문이다.






돈사돈에서는 흑돼지 목살과 삼겹살의 두툼한 두께에 한 번, 고소한 육즙에 두 번 놀란다. 그렇게 구미가 당긴다고 해서 집게로 성급하게 고기를 구워선 안 된다. 이 집 고기 맛을 좌우하는 것은, 고기의 결을 살려주는&nbsp;스태프들의 능숙한 굽기 실력에서 나오는 것이기 때문이다. 직원분들이 친절하게 고기를 구워 딱 먹기 좋을 때에 접시에 담아주고,&nbsp;먹는 방법까지 설명해주니 최고로 맛있는 제주 흑돼지를 편안하게 맛볼 수 있다. 넘치는 육즙의 돼지고기와 멜젓이 찰떡궁합이며, 식사의 끝에&nbsp;김치찌개까지 맛보면&nbsp;입 안이 깔끔하게 정리된다.

경미네집은 성산일출봉 근처에 위치한 소규모 식당이다. 경미네집에서 가장 유명한 메뉴는 해물라면이다. 문어와 오징어, 조개가 듬뿍 들어간 해물라면이 있고 밥은 무료로 제공한다. 그 외에 전복밥이나 성게밥 등 덮밥류가 있는데 당일 잡은 싱싱한 해산물을 이용한다. 싱싱함 덕분에 비린내도 덜해 평소 날음식을 잘 먹지 못하는 이들도 맛있게 먹을 수 있다. 다만 성게밥 같은 경우, 철이 아닐 때에는 먹기가 어려우니 참고하기 바란다. 이곳의 인기를 입증하듯 낙서로 벽면과 천장이 도배되었다. 외국인들도 많이 찾는 곳이라 외국화폐들이 벽면에 붙여져 있는 것도 새로운 풍경이다. 사람이 많아 주차할 공간이 좁으니 근처 성산일출봉에 주차해서 10분쯤 걸어오는 것을 추천한다.

On every table in Eojinine Hoetjip, there are two kinds of vinegar: apple cider vinegar and glacial acetic acid. 
Most natives of Jeju would pick the green bottle of glacial acetic acid (food grade, of course), while people from other areas would mostly choose apple vinegar. 
The most obvious way to check how vinegar changes the taste of the cold raw fish soup dish is this: 
When they bring the dish out, taste a spoonful of it. Then, add a couple of drops of vinegar to the dish and stir it. Again, taste a slice of raw fish and a spoonful of broth. 
You will be amazed by how smooth the taste and texture of everything — from the raw fish to the broth — has become.

Gyorae Sonkalguksu (Gyorae Hand-made Noodle Soup), which offers a flavorful noodle soup with local Korean chicken, and the refreshing noodle soup with clams are the best. Apart from the main meals, you can also order buckwheat and vegetable pancake and other items.  

The healthy green noodles are the result of great effort. They knead the dough and make the noodles by hand. The freshly made raw noodles are cooked as soon as the order is made. The noodles need to be boiled for 20~30 minutes, so it is recommended to place several orders at once to avoid a longer wait.

Its fame has recently attracted the former president of Indonesia as a visitor.

With its close proximity to the Jungmun Tourist Complex  and large parking lot, this restaurant makes it easier for visitors such as golf tourists to stop by.

Their large dining space accommodates 180 seats. Plenty of tables are prepared to help reduce the waiting time. Outside the restaurant, a separate terrace for resting is available.

Fresh, high-quality black pork from partner farmers is aged at a low temperature to enhance the flavor. Their meat items (500 g/750 g) provide appropriate mixes of pork shoulder, pork belly with skin, and a special cut of pork called solji. Other meals including local handmade sausage and various types of stews, rice soup, and noodles are available as well. Among them, the seasonal dish young radish noodles that is available only in summer is a delicacy.

Mokpogoeul not only makes every side dish, but also their soybean paste, soy sauce, cabbage kimchi, and green onion kimchi. Different-sized crocks of ingredients stand in rows in their backyard. According to the owner, the secret to this restaurant's delicious food lies in the ability to know the taste of every dish and to adjust different ingredients for a harmonious flavor, that is, the ability which comes from more than 30 years of experience in the food service industry.

When it is ordered, the meat is cut to a thickness that goes well with the briquette fire according to experience, and is placed on the grill. A skilled employee cooks the meat from the start, and when the meat is done he/she puts it aside. The combination of the meat’s same thickness, high quality, and the employee’s good cooking skill offers a consistently tasty meal whenever you visit. 

In order for customers to fully experience the taste of their meat, Mokpogoeul does not serve any ssamjang (seasoned soybean paste) and raw vegetables.

공항과 가깝고 널찍한 주차장을 끼고 있는 독채 고깃집이라, 교통이 편리하고 찾기가 수월하다. 홀 규모가 커서 가족 모임이나 회식 장소로도 적격이다. 노형동 본점에서는 다른 지역의 고기보다 훨씬 두툼하게 썰어낸, 일명 '제주도 근고기'를 제공한다. 흑돈가에서는 콜레스테롤이 낮고 지방산 함량이 높아 건강식으로 환영받는 흑돼지를 숯불에 굽는 방식과, 멜젓을 찍어먹는 제주식을 합하였다. 이러면 고기가 기름은 빠진 상태에서 숯향은 머금어 적당히 기름지고 향긋하다. 거기에 폴폴 끓인 멜젖을 찍거나 깻잎 장아찌와 함께 먹으면 찰떡궁합이다.

2016 KOREAT JEJU TOP 10 선정단 한줄평 : 두툼하게 썬 제주의 흑돼지와 멜젓은 그저 '옳다'. 멜젓은 추자도에서 건너온 것에 사장님의 비법 양념을 더해 그 풍미를 완성했다.

제주미향은 회, 조림, 전골, 구이 등 메뉴가 굉장히 다양하다. 

그러나 많은 손님들이 제주미향을 찾는 이유는 단연 통갈치구이 때문이다. 

기다란 통갈치구이가 나오면 여기저기서 찰칵거리는 소리가 들릴 것이다.

Their only dish is noodle soup with top shells, which boasts the deep natural flavor of top shells, a type of sea snail. This soup is a traditional meal in Jeju, and is said to have originated from the noodle soup that the haenyeo (women divers) cooked during their free time. They collected top shells from rocks on the seashore, removed their flesh, and simmered them, and then added the noodles to complete the soup.

This already popular restaurant became even more so after appearing on “Wednesday Food Talk” (Ep. 20, Jeju Food, June 10, 2016). As it is full of customers from the time it opens at 11:00, putting your name on the waiting list is common. Fortunately, the restaurant has a high customer turnover, so if you take a look around the Daejeong Fifth-day Market, you will notice that your turn comes soon. However, you must go early since the restaurant may close even at 14:00 if they run out of ingredients.

Their noodle soup with top shells dish has a hearty amount of green broth with the rich flavor of top shells, and thick noodles. Slices of fried tofu on top are an excellent choice. The pieces of fried tofu carrying the rich broth are sweet and tender. A tip to make your noodle soup tastier is to add a spoonful of minced chili pepper. Those who enjoy spicy food will be totally satisfied. 
As the restaurant is near the port, a lot of visitors going to Marado Island and Gapado Island stop by. The nearby public parking lot allows a pleasant visit by car. In addition, after finishing your meal, you should try the flavorful buckwheat crepes with sunflower seeds sold on one side of the restaurant.

2016 KOREAT JEJU TOP 10 judges’ comment: This place serves the best noodle soup with top shells that I’ve ever had. A perfect dish that combines the time, effort, and Jeju’s sea.

대문 닫힐 새 없이 손님들이 드나드는 인기 식당이다. 본래도 인기가 있었지만 tvN 수요 미식회 등 여러 방송 매체에 출연하면서 휴무일마저 사라질 정도로 바빠졌다. 인기는 늘어났지만 인심은 그대로다. 연중무휴 자리를 지키는 사장님이 카운터와 주방을 쉴 새 없이 오가며 손님들을 챙긴다.&nbsp;가게 입구에는 문재인 대통령을 비롯한 유명 인사들이 남긴 방문 흔적이 눈에 띈다.&nbsp;

주변 관광지로는 천지연폭포, 정방폭포, 외돌개 등이 있으며 특히&nbsp;올레시장과는 도보로 10분 거리이기 때문에 시장관광 전 후로 이용하기 좋다. 다소 떨어진 인근에 공영주차장이 있다.&nbsp;

약 80명이 들어올 수 있는 실내에는 입식 좌석, 좌식 좌석, 룸 등 각자의 취향에 맞는 자리가 다양하게 준비되어 있다. 매장이 넓으니 가족모임이나 단체회식도 가능하다.

갈치, 고등어, 옥돔 등 여러 생선 요리를 선보이지만 가장 유명한 것은 갈치 요리다. 낚시로 잡은 제주산 생 은갈치만을 사용하는 덕에 어느 메뉴를 먹어도 구수하고 고소한 갈치 맛을 느낄 수가 있다. 갈치구이나 갈치조림은 기본적인 메뉴이고, 특히 유명한 요리는 갈치국이다. 갈치국을 처음 접하는 관광객들 또한&nbsp;익숙한&nbsp;갈치조림이나 갈치구이를 먹으러 왔다가 갈치국에 반해 돌아간다는 설명이다.

자칫 비릴 것 같지만 전혀 그렇지 않다. 통통한 갈치에 배추로 낸 시원한 국물과&nbsp;늙은 호박의 은은한 단맛이 어울리는데, 여기에&nbsp;청양고추의 매운 맛이 끝 마무리를 담당하니 개운하고 구수하다.

갈치 외 생선들은 '구이'와 '정식' 가격이 구분돼 있다. 구이에 비해 약 1/2 가격인 정식은 좀 더 작은 생선으로 저렴하게 이 집의 맛을 즐길 수 있는 숨은 메뉴다.

Café Saudy is a cafe on Olle walking trail No. 12 at Jagunae Port and opposite the beautiful islet of Chagwido, on the far west side of Jeju, a perfect place to watch the sunset. 

This spot has been covered in such publications as the Lonely Planet, Olive Magazine Korea, and travel writer Shin Young-chul's tomes “Second Jeju Cafe” and “Second Jeju Olle.”

There’s a good reason for this press. They use Terra Rossa roasted coffee beans, and have various homemade drinks and desserts. And they say they avoid using any artificial additives and the desserts are made fresh on the day.

Our recommendation is special tea in Jeju such as organic tangerine tea, coffee, herbal tea, a fresh fruit smoothie,
and snow bingsu (very thin ice flakes) especially in the summer.

You can have a meal as well. We serve homemade Jeju black pork cutlets,
tomato pasta with octopus and abalone and grilled shrimp cream pasta.

You can also can buy unique souvenirs that artists in Jeju produce in small quantities
(haenyeo candles, harubang candles, haenyeo mobiles, haenyeo magnets, hanrabong soaps, tea coasters, etc.).

Shop owners can speak English and Japanese so you won’t have any difficulty shopping. Feel free to ask anything about traveling Jeju.

Their large parking lot for up to 50 vehicles makes the visit easier.

The key to their inexpensive and splendid food results from fresh ingredients directly purchased from haenyeo (women divers). Haenyeo collect fresh seafood from the nearby sea and sort those ingredients at their work site next to the restaurant.

Their large space can accommodate about 70 visitors. Private rooms are also available.

Doduhaenyeouijip has a reputation for their fine cold raw fish soup. Even though the soup is served with crushed ice, its sweet and sour taste, along with fresh seafood, successfully attracts customers in winter. The most beloved dish is cold raw fish soup special. Generally, the dish includes abalone, sea urchin, spear squid, seaweed and vegetables. However, if those ingredients are scarce, other fresh ingredients are used instead. In addition, cold raw fish soup is enjoyed with rice instead of noodles on Jejudo Island.

Deokseongwon, which opened in 1945, boasts their history of nearly 100 years. Their long history is brilliantly proven by an award that they received from Chiang Kai-shek, the former chairman of the National Government of China, for providing help during an aviation accident in Taiwan. The year 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the arrival of their Chinese ancestors to Jeju. Though it has been a long time since the couple has handed over the place to their son, the still hale and hearty owners of the second generation appear at the restaurant to maintain their best taste and service.

The wide, 150-seat dining space, which includes five private dining rooms, offers a comfortable mealtime. Despite the many seats, reservations are required on weekends and summer holiday season due to the restaurant’s great popularity.
The list of favorite dishes is as long as the restaurant’s history. Among them, the items that best deliver the taste of beautiful Jeju include stir-fried blue crab (or sweet and sour blue crab) and spicy seafood noodle soup with blue crab, which is made with fleshy blue crab. In either dish, the blue crab is dressed for customers to consume it without difficulty. 

Sweet and sour pork, a symbolic Chinese dish, is also a popular item. Deokseongwon’s sweet and sour pork is fried with sweet potato starch entirely from Jeju, and as a result, the dish offers a distinctive soft texture, which is maintained even when the food cools down. 

Boiled dumplings that were even supplied to Cheong Wa Dae, spicy seafood noodle soup with extra seafood that contains white broth with a clean taste, and sweet and sour pheasant that is specialty of Deokseongwon are other popular dishes. In particular, Deokseongwon was the first to serve the sweet and sour pheasant dish, which uses pheasants common on the island until now.

수복강녕은&nbsp;제주시&nbsp;도청후문에 위치한 수제떡갈비 전문점이다. 위치 및 대중교통이 좋아 관광객이 찾아가기에도 좋다. 5대 정도를 댈 수 있는 작은 주차장 또한 마련되어 있어 더욱 편리하다.

가정집을 개조한 내부는 친척 댁에 놀러온 느낌이 들 정도로 아늑하다. 홀 5 테이블, 방 2테이블이 준비되어 있으며, 방은 각종 모임이나 가족 손님이 이용하기 좋다.

떡갈비재료는 하루에 판매할양만큼만 만들어 판매하고 있다. 특히 고기는 제주도산 흑돼지를 사용하는데, 카운터에 흑돼지 검사 증명서를 상시 비치해 놓을 정도로 신뢰를 얻기 위해 노력하고 있다. 고기 외에도 매일매일 신선한재료를 준비하고 만들기 때문에 집밥 느낌으로 식사할 수 있다.&nbsp;조리 또한 미리 해 놓는 것이 아니라 손님이 주문함과 동시에 석쇠로 직화하기 때문에 10~15분 정도가 소요된다. 콩과 수산물 외에는 모두 국내산을 사용한다.&nbsp;

메뉴는 단 한가지 떡갈비다. 재료가 돼지냐, 한우냐만이 다를 뿐이다. 전문점 답게 번잡스럽지 않은 구성이다.&nbsp;

이 집 떡갈비의 특징은&nbsp;자르지 않고 네모진, 시루떡 같은 모습으로&nbsp;제공한다는 점이다. 호쾌한 그 모습에 먹기 전부터 배가 부른 느낌이다.&nbsp;노릇하고 육즙이 넘치니 맛 좋은 것은 물론이다. 제공되는 각종 반찬과 함께 쌈을 싸 먹으면 더욱 다양한 맛을 즐길 수 있다.

예약 우선으로 영업하는 만큼 예약전화문의는 선택이 아닌 필수다. 부부가 직원없이 영업할 뿐더러,&nbsp;재료 소진 시 영업을 마감하기 때문이다. 예약 없이 찾으면 대기시간이 길거나, 재료가 소진되어 맛보지 못하는 상황이 생길 수도 있다.&nbsp;


맡반찬은 맛깔스런 전라도식으로 다양하게&nbsp;제공되는데, 재료에 따라 항상 조금씩 변경하는 노력을 기울이고 있다.

Kim, who has lived in Jeju for nearly a decade, runs this rice bowl dish restaurant in the deep woods where pheasants run around.

This place has only one employee, the chef himself. Chef Kim manages the cooking and serving alone. He originally made different Japanese home-style meals every day, but changed the menu to rice bowl dishes for efficient cooking. As seats are offered in a public dining space, including next to the counter and in private dining rooms, you can sit anywhere you like.

The menu is simple: three rice bowl dishes (grilled Patagonian  toothfish with rice, seafood with rice, and stir-fried pork with rice), three à la carte dishes (deep-fried shrimp, deep-fried chicken, and chicken ramen), and bowls of rice. The most popular rice dishes are grilled Patagonian  toothfish with rice and seafood with rice. In particular, its seafood with rice, which contains tuna, Jeju abalone, and octopus, is an evolution of Japanese Kaisendon. Customers should not miss chicken ramen in winter. The grilled chicken and citrus sauce in the dish have a nice clean taste.

The rice bowl dishes and side dishes are served beautifully on neat wooden trays. The rice bowl dish with steamed hijiki rice and various ingredients on top is a hearty dish that will make you full. Although the side dishes only consist of Japanese style soybean paste soup, slightly pickled vegetables, potato salad, and poached eggs, each one is prepared with devotion to provide you with pleasure.

Chef Kim Seung-min explains that the key to his restaurant’s success is “rushing around and sparing no expense for good ingredients, and selling food with an honest heart.”

The restaurant, located in the woods next to a wayside, is difficult to visit without a car. Since there is a small parking lot in front of the restaurant, it is easier for drivers to pay a visit.",20161201105600,20240810020030,"[{'seq': 20735, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CNTS_000000000020810', 'label': 'Morinoaruyo', 'refId': 'CNTS_000000000020810'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000000005', 'label': 'Cuisine', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000000005'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'cate0000001268', 'label': 'Japanese', 'refId': 'cate0000000005>cate0000001268'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'cate0000001312', 'label': 'Japanese', 'refId': 'cate0000001268>cate0000001312'}, 'created': '20191106160623'}, {'seq': 20736, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CNTS_000000000020810', 'label': 'Morinoaruyo', 'refId': 'CNTS_000000000020810'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000000005', 'label': 'Cuisine', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000000005'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'cate0000001273', 'label': None, 'refId': 'cate0000000005>cate0000001273'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'cate0000001316', 'label': None, 'refId': 'cate0000001273>cate0000001316'}, 'created': '20191106160623'}]",,,,c4,Restaurant,contentscd>c4,region1,Jeju-si,region>region1,12,Aewol,region1>12,모리노아루요,9845.0,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/imgpath/201804/30/43de44a9-b475-474e-89d3-52e4bf62d84e.jpg,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/thumbnailpath/201804/30/31369cfb-b76f-4f6e-873a-f44f8bda62ba.jpg,food,

소바에는 기본적으로 새우튀김이 1개 올라가며 최대 2개를 추가해서 먹을 수 있다. 소바에 올라가는 고추냉이와 무, 김, 새우튀김은 자극적이지 않은 육수와 잘 어울린다. 
유부초밥은 특별한 속 재료가 들어가진 않지만, 일본에서 공수해온 유부의 달짝지근함을 느낄 수 있다.

Their signature dishes are hot-pot rice with abalone and ginseng chicken soup with abalone. The ginseng chicken soup, which contains an entire chicken and abalone, offers a delightfully refreshing broth. The hot-pot rice with abalone boasts not only delectable rice mixed with a lot of chewy abalone slices, but also delicious scorched rice on the bottom of the stone pot. Both items include plenty of abalone, which are, interestingly enough, cultivated by the restaurant directly.

Since the abalone Dolseom uses have been carefully cultivated for at least 2 years in the nearby sea, they offer outstanding freshness and taste.



What is added to these excellent ingredients is the touch of Dolseom’s master, who has worked in the restaurant industry for more than 20 years. Dolseom also boasts about being the first restaurant to create hot-pot rice with abalone dish and spread the dish across the island. Other items on the menu include abalone porridge, ginseng chicken soup, grilled black pork and abalone, and grilled pork belly with skin. The black pork dishes are also delicious; recently, many tourists from Hong Kong who love pork dishes have been visiting for a meal.



Every side dish, as well as the main dishes, is prepared with care. They not only cook the side dishes by themselves, but also make their own salted mackerel. While this nicely salty and palatable grilled mackerel is a one-dish meal, if you order any two rice menus, half of a grilled mackerel is also served.

바삭한 튀김도 맛있지만 특히 손에 꼽는 것은 면이다.
최고의 밀가루를 사용하여 족타 반죽 후 24시간 숙성하여 직접 썰어내는 면의 맛에 반해 생면만 사 가는 사람들도 많다.
(붓가케 쯔유 포함 4인분 10,000원)

이 곳의 4대 베스트 메뉴는 흑돼지 생돈가스, 텐붓가케 우동, 왕새우튀김 우동, 가츠동(돈가스 덮밥)이다.
특히 더운 여름에는 소스를 뿌려 시원하게 먹는 텐붓가케 우동이 잘 나간다는 설명이다.
모든 메뉴는 '정식'으로 주문할 경우 유부초밥이 함께 나온다.
2개월마다 메뉴에 변화를 주기 때문에 자주 와도 질리지 않는다는 점도 자랑할 만 하다.

이 곳의 왕새우 튀김은 유명 백화점과 호텔에서 배워갔을 정도로 명성이 높다.
새우 중 가장 큰 어종인 블랙 타이거를 사용하기 때문에 양이 충분하여 그 맛을 충분히 느낄 수 있다.
새우 뿐만 아니라 모든 재료에 신경을 쓰고 있는 것은 물론이다.
돈까스는 제주도산 흑돼지를 사용하고 있고, 모든 샐러드 드레싱은 직접 만들어 건강을 챙기고 있다.

우동 주문 시, 삶는 시간을 고려하여 15분의 여유가 필요하다.
너무나 배가 고픈 사람이라면 고로케와&nbsp;유부초밥 등 사이드 메뉴를 먼저 주문하는 것도 방법이다.

맛 외에 이 집에서 느낄 수 있는 또 하나의 재미는 정겨운 제주 사투리다.
제주에 놀러온 관광객들이 제주 사투리 한 번 듣고 가지 못하는 것이 안타까웠다는 주인장 부부는
인테리어와 메뉴판은 물론, 접대 시에도 제주 사투리를 쓰려 노력하고 있다.
제주어 지킴이를 자부하는 두 내외 덕에 이 곳에서는 진짜 제주를 느낄 수 있다.

어릴 적 어머니가 끓여준 ‘고등어죽’은 주인장의 소울푸드였다.
한 그릇이면 기운이 솟던 그 맛을 평생 간직하고 싶어 어머니에게 비법을 전수받아 ‘고등어해장국’을 만들었다
. 고등어를 삶아 살을 발라내고 해장국에 넣는다.
이때 남은 머리와 뼈는 갈아서 육수로 우린다.
얼큰한 해장국에 들깨가루를 넣어 고소함으로 균형을 맞췄다.

The Vols Kafé is located in a converted old mandarin orange storehouse in rural Seogwipo, an area well known for its mandarin farming. It’s a large white building in the middle of an orchard. The cafe is on the first floor and a bakery is on the second floor. The cafe has a wide range of interesting, beautiful, and delicious desserts to choose from. 

One of their popular menu items is cold brewed coffee in stylishly designed packaging. You’ll also notice the similarly stylish interior design, and the large picture window that shows off the Jeju scenery outside.



This is a rural area with many orchards around, so if it’s not too windy outside, the cafe’s terrace is an excellent option. There’s a good chance you’ll find this to be one of the more picture-perfect, memorable Jeju coffee experiences you have while here.

Me and Jeju provides an opportunity for you to create your own designs in Jeju. You can design items by using volcanic stones designated as natural minerals that are only found in Jeju, and natural flower scents of the Island. You can experience four main themes: plaster air fresheners with sea flowers, car air fresheners with volcanic stones, personalized pottery, and Jeju on canvas.
1. Plaster air fresheners with sea flowers: You can make your own plaster air fresheners by placing volcanic stones, seashells, and flowers on drywall with natural flower scents of the Island as a final touch.
2. Car air fresheners with volcanic stones: You can make your own car air fresheners by combining volcanic stones and seashells in a bottle, then adding your choice of natural flower scents of the Island to complete your customized design.
3. Personalized pottery: You can make your own customized pottery by decorating your creation with pens, seashells, and volcanic stones.

Both are impressive for their views and are very popular with visitors.
Like the name of the shop, these Jeju soap souvenirs twinkle  to attract travelers.
Their signature, low-temperature, hand-made soaps look like a slice of sweet pound cake. The healing landscape that comes to mind when thinking of Jeju is incorporated into this marvellous soap.
In particular, the Hallasan Soap, with its blue sky and white clouds floating around in it, is very popular because you can feel Jeju as it is.

The beauty of the soap doesn't mean it's not useful as soap itself. In fact the low-temperature, hand-crafted soap is carefully made with natural ingredients such as blue powder, menthol, charcoal powder and paprika powder and subjected to a long drying period of four weeks .
Thanks to this, people with sensitive skin can use it with confidence. Try different soaps and choose the one that suits you best.

There's more to Twinkle Jeju than just soap. They sell Jeju ocean candles, fragrances, and knitting accessories.
The Aewol branch opened in March 2019, so you can find handmade soaps and accessories while traveling west.

Jeju’s spring festival held in green fields of barley




Gapado is an island that is about a 20-minutes boat ride from Moseulpo Port in Seogwipo. It is an island in an island, located in the southernmost part of Korea. There are many stories behind the island’s name. In one story, Gapado got its name because its shape resembles a stingray (Gaori in Korean). Most of the islanders in Gapado work in the fishing industry, but some of the others cultivate crops for living.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 




In April, the entire island is filled with green waves of barley. The barley fields take up about 600,000㎡ of the island. Most of the green barley grown in Gapado Island are native species of Jeju called ‘Hyang-Maek.’ They are taller than regular barley, which is why the green waves in the barley fields of Gapado Island move more dynamically with the wind.

Wondam is a traditional fishing method in Jeju from the old days when people piled stones to trap fish that come in with the tide.

The seas of Jeju Island offer various attractions, no matter where you look. Offering a refreshing feeling with the water’s colors, ranging from transparent to vivid emerald, Keumneung-eutteumwon Beach shows off one of the most superb sights in the west of Jeju. From Keumneung-eutteumwon Beach, you can see all of Biyangdo, which looks like a boa constrictor that swallowed an elephant in the Little Prince, at a glance.    

The exotic view that features a wide emerald sea and palm trees makes everyone amazed. On a clear day, you can take in the whole of Biyangdo Island at a single glance, which resembles the boa constrictor that swallowed an elephant in The Little Prince. 

Although Keumneung-eutteumwon Beach is not as well-known as crowded Hyeopjae Beach, it is just as beautiful. It has wide stretches of white sandy beach for sunbathing, a nearby campground for relaxing, and above all, the most scenic spot to watch the Jeju sunset. 

Established to bring attention to the traditional Korean culture of “Wondam” during the summer vacation season, Keumneungwondam Festival is celebrating its 12th anniversary this year. Wondam is a traditional fishing method in Jeju from the old days when people piled stones to trap fish that come in with the tide. Wondam means a net made with stones, and it is also called stone net.       

There are 4 wondams (stone nets) in Geumneung: Sowon with its numerous pebbles, Mareunwon that is always dry because of a lack of water, Jibarwon that is situated on the beach just under the residential area, Joreukiwon that is named after the place, Jawurak. It is said that hairtails were also caught by Wondam in the old days.

The sandy beach of Geumneung Beach is called Seonjinteo, a name that is taken from the way fish were caught there. When the water came into the sandy field, village people used to come out to spread the 200m net and pull it on both sides to catch the fish that were in the net. This method was called “seonjin,” and the place where people caught fish using that method was called ‘Seonjinteo.’     

The Geumneung Wondam Festival takes place at Geumneung Beach, and includes sea activities such as catching fish bare-handed and experiencing traditional ways of fishing, as well as Baek Nana Song Festival in memory of Baek Nana, a famous singer originally from Geumneung. Also, because Geumneung is friendly and its weather is mild, the number of people who move here to live has been increasing in recent years. For this reason, various kinds of programs that help those people to get to know their neighbors are offered during the festival. There are also other festival programs such as taking a stroll along the Wondam road, orchestra concerts at Geumneung Wondam, catching gingi (crabs) and clams, and more. 

Keumneungwondam Festival takes place on Keumneung-eutteumwon Beach, offering sea activities such as catching fish with your bare hands and experiencing traditional fishing. There are also festival programs that local residents support such as orchestra concerts and taking strolls along the Wondam Street.",20170725182854,20240810020040,"[{'seq': 45128, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CNTS_000000000022197', 'label': '2019 Keumneungwondam Festival', 'refId': 'CNTS_000000000022197'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000001360', 'label': 'Festivals', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000001360'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'cate0000001361', 'label': 'Festival', 'refId': 'cate0000001360>cate0000001361'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'cate0000001362', 'label': 'Festival', 'refId': 'cate0000001361>cate0000001362'}, 'created': '20240724174917'}]",,,,c5,Festivals / Events,contentscd>c5,region1,Jeju-si,region>region1,13,Hallim,region1>13,금능 원담축제,2019022636734.0,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/imgpath/202407/24/6b124e68-3cb3-4406-a14d-3f2dc533e216.jpg,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/thumbnailpath/202407/24/97fdb0bc-31cf-4962-b817-656bd7031d60.jpg,festivals,

The canola flower is one of the flowers of spring that represent Jeju. In the southern region where the climate remains warm, even by Jeju’s standard, the bright yellow canola flowers start to bloom at the end of winter and last throughout spring. Canola flowers are found everywhere in Jeju, and they are known to have been planted in large volumes in Jeju since the 1960s. This is because they grow well, even in cold and humid weather, and are highly suited for Jeju’s barren soil.&nbsp; 




However, fewer people have been growing canola flowers in Jeju since the 1980s, and the festival was introduced in 1983 to promote the beauty of canola flowers. It started as the “Grand Canola Flower Party,” which was held alternately in Jeju-si and Seogwipo-si. In 2016, the name was changed to the Jeju Canola Flower Festival, and the festival ground was established in Gasi-ri, Pyoseon-myeon in Seogwipo-si.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Even during the 1970s, most households in Jeju raised two or three cows to plow the land and transport the harvest from the field to home or market. There was a tradition for livestock workers in each town to take turns and drive all the cattle out to the hilly areas to pasture during winter. The cowherd in charge, or shweteuri, would drive the cattle through the hilly fields to find quality grass. For this purpose, people burnt down the fields during the time between late winter and early spring to renew the greens and exterminate vermin (an event called bangae). This tradition is rooted from the wisdom of Korea's ancestors, who lived alongside nature. During the bangae period, the burning fields all over the hilly areas of Jeju made a spectacular sight.&nbsp;

Jeju’s damselfish has a lot of calcium and has a rich, nutty taste. It is in season during the summer, from May to August. It is eaten in various ways such as cold sashimi soup, rolls, grilled, salad, or pickled. Damselfish is commonly used to make cold sashimi soup and grilled meat, and it is also eaten pickled with bean leaves.

Starting in 1994, this festival has taken charge of Jeju’s summer for over 20 years. The festival became so popular that there are even festival fans who have gone to the festival every year.

This is because the festival offers a wide range of genres in music such as classical, pop, jazz, rock, vocal music, chorus, and traditional Korean music. The average number of audience members per show reaches 1,000.

The festival is held at Tapdong Beach Theater, the best outdoor theater in Jeju. Since the ocean lies right behind the theater, it gives the impression that the theater is floating above the water. The atmosphere of the concerts is very casual. Couples on dates, families taking a night stroll with a baby in a stroller, and people in track suits come to the concerts. 

During the past 20 extra years, renowned musicians are invited sometimes to play at the festival, but the festival proudly features local artists. As long as the musicians are passionate in music, the festival doesn’t mind if the artists are professionals or amateurs and invites them to introduce their music to Jeju citizens. 


From Music to Dance, a Feast of Art That Will Make You Forget the Heat of Tropical Nights

The ‘Midsummer Night’s Art Festival’ rocked Tapdong Beach in Jeju for a week, drawing attendants from all generations and receiving a great deal of attention on social media. First held in 1994, the midsummer night’s art festival has become more than a one-time event, and has been praised for its various efforts to make connections between local art and culture and the public. As there are not many nighttime attractions in Jeju, the festival has seen a steady stream of visitors.  

Offering activities that make people forget the heat of tropical nights, the festival not only brings in local residents but has also attracted a number of fans who travel to attend the festival every year. During the week, the festival is visited by people from all generations, including parents holding the hands of with their young children, tourists attracted by the music and senior citizens.",20170703170551,20240809165952,"[{'seq': 39779, 'contentsid': {'value': 'CNTS_000000000022052', 'label': 'Midsummer Night’s Art Festival', 'refId': 'CNTS_000000000022052'}, 'cate1cd': {'value': 'cate0000001360', 'label': 'Festivals', 'refId': 'contscate>cate0000001360'}, 'cate2cd': {'value': 'cate0000001361', 'label': 'Festival', 'refId': 'cate0000001360>cate0000001361'}, 'cate3cd': {'value': 'cate0000001362', 'label': 'Festival', 'refId': 'cate0000001361>cate0000001362'}, 'created': '20230725161650'}]",,,,c5,Festivals / Events,contentscd>c5,region1,Jeju-si,region>region1,11,Jeju-si,region1>11,2019 한여름 밤의 예술축제,2019022557525.0,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/imgpath/201907/08/ea2f912a-530b-43a9-9ba6-332e0b3ed2f9.JPG,https://api.cdn.visitjeju.net/photomng/thumbnailpath/201907/08/94c950a5-a6e6-4576-97d7-035c2d27ba39.JPG,festivals,

Favored by locals, Samyang is close to the city center and has a wide range of attractions including the mountains, seas, and historical sites. A long stretch of black beach is a rare sight in Jeju, and the black sand’s therapeutic effect on neuralgia, arthritis, obesity, dermatitis, prevention of colds, and athlete’s foot has been known for a long time.

Samyang’s black sand is particularly fine and soft, which makes it better for a sand bath. Samyang is also famous for its abundant spring water. After taking a sand bath, you can cool down your heated body in the spring water, which is a nice way to beat the midsummer heat right away.  

Samyang in Jeju is renowned for its clean and abundant fresh spring water. Saetdori Water, which is located within a 5-minute walk from the beach, serves as a source of fresh drinking water, a bathhouse, and a recreation park for the town. Recently, it has drawn renewed attention as a natural water park during summer break. It is a place where all people, young and old, can enjoy a relaxing time.

Samyang also offers a magnificent sunset view. The shiny black sand bounces off sunlight, creating a view that looks like a landscape painting. Because of the lighting system installed all around the region, many people come to visit, even at nighttime.

Samyang’s Historical and Cultural Trails in NatureIn Samyang, you can see the prehistoric culture of Jeju at a glance. The “Samyang’s History Ole Trail” includes important historic sites such as Samyang-dong prehistoric sites and Treasure No. 1187, the Five-Storied Stone Pagoda of Bultapsa Temple, along with the black sand beach, refreshing spring water, and Wondangbong. This 9.6 km trail generally takes 4 hours including short breaks and sightseeing. Jeju Ole Trail No. 18, which leads to Bultapsa Temple through Samyang Black Sand Beach and the entrance of Wondangbong, is also a good walking route.

Jeju is the country of 18,000 heavenly gods. These heavenly gods are summoned by the great god of heaven and travel to heaven during “Shingugan.” In the old days, the people of Jeju believed that they should only move or repair their houses during “Shingugan” to avoid upsetting the gods. When it is time for gods to come back to Jeju Island after “Shingugan,” the shamans held a ritual to welcome the gods back. This ritual is called “Ip-chun Gut.” Back then, numerous shamans serving the guardian gods of each town would come together in Gwan-deok-jeong.

Chujado Island is recognized as a rich fishing ground, even in Jeju. The yellow corvina, Spanish mackerel, and anchovy caught in Chujado Island are considered the best. Barnacle dish, raw half beak bibimbap, raw black porgy, and raw anchovy are famous wild seafood dishes that people can’t usually find in other areas.

The entire area of Chujado Island is 7.05km², only one 263th of the whole island of Jeju, and the length of the coastline is around 22.8㎞. This small island has such attractions that people can’t get enough of for days and days. Bonggeullesan Mountain, with its height of 85.5m, is located in the northernmost part of Sang-chujado. This mountain is not that tall, but due to its outstanding location just in front of the southern sea, people can see the whole area of Chujado Island from the mountaintop. This is the No. 1 tourist attraction to visit when the weather is clear.

A festival is held every year in September to enjoy yellow corvina when it’s in season. The 3-day festival is packed with events, such as pungeaje (Festival praying for a good haul) and yongwangje (Dragon King Feast), which are rituals held to get big catches of fish and for the safety of fishermen, exhibits of works by Chujado artists, fishing boat parade, and other activities.

People can enjoy scenic views of Chujado Island, taste fresh seafood, and experience Jeju’s unique traditional culture. Visitors can participate in the Spanish mackerel and yellow corvina tasting event, seafood grilling and eating, and yellow corvina picking. They can also experience the striking needle bar, net weaving, yellow corvina weaving, gaetbadang bareut catching, family fishing, and Chuja Olle Trail.

Chujado Island is home to a variety of cultures. There is a shrine to General Choe Yeong within a short walking distance, just outside the venue at Sang-chuja port. In the time of Gongmin of Goryeo, General Choe Yeong headed to Jeju to settle the Revolt of Mokho. He was forced to stay there, and so he taught the villagers advanced fishing skills. The villagers then built a shrine for him to commemorate his good deeds.

While waiting for the boat to the Jeju cruise terminal, people can take a stroll on the Jeju Olle 18-1 route and enjoy a different view of the island. This 18km trail is designed for visitors to enjoy the sight of the beautiful islands and the sea.
